# Malaria-incidence
## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and report the incidence of malaria for different countries and years using the World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics for 2020. The program will read data from the "incedenceOfMalaria.csv" file and provide information based on the provided argument

## Input
The program will accept a single argument, which can be either a year or a country name.

## Data Source
The program will read data from the "incedenceOfMalaria.csv" file, which will be placed in the same directory as the program.

## Output
- If the argument is a year, the program should report the country with the highest incidence and the corresponding incidence value for that year.
- If the argument is a country, the program should report the year with the highest incidence and the corresponding incidence value for that country.
- If there are multiple occurrences of the highest incidence, the program should handle it in a way that makes sense to the user.
